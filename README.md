# better-whitespace

Now, [Whitespace](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Whitespace) is a pretty good language. One of the best, you might say. But it's not for everyone.

Some people have ethical objections to the use of tabs in their code - and even if that's an incorrect opinion, I respect your right to have it. So we put our best engineers onto the task, and three years later, we came up with _better-whitespace_, a language that uses only spaces and newlines.

### Features

- ✔️ Turing complete
- ✔️ Deletes itself if you try to use tabs in your code since you clearly can't be trusted
- ✔️ Interpreted
- ✔️ Code secure against screen-watching attacks
- ✔️ Built in syntax highlighting
